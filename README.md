# snake-game
Really, really, REALLY simple snake game with multiplayer.
W, A, S, D to change the direction, SPACE to stop.
Has a name screen and chat box (probably will add CSS later).
Really buggy:
  - Can just randomly die (no clue why)
  - Input delay (might be server side)
  - Keyboard inputs apply in game when typing in chat box.
